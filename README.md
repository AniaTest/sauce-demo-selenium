# Automation Testing with Selenium and JavaScript

This is a portfolio test suit I've created using JavaScript, Selenium Webdriver, Mocha and Chai. It provides automated tests for https://www.saucedemo.com/ sample application.

## Getting Started

You need to install either [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. In this project, I will use Node for installing packages and running scripts.

```sh
npm install
```

## Running UI Test

```sh
npm run test
```
